# Next-word-Prediction-System
Next word prediction is a NLP task where a model predicts the most likely word to follow a given sequence of words or context.


The system aims to generate coherent and contextually relevant suggestions for the next word based on the patterns and relationships learned from training data. Most of the keyboards in smartphones give next word prediction features. Google also uses next word prediction based on our browsing history.
In simple words, it means picking the word that follows a string of words based on them that is most likely to occur. For this project we will be using 3-words string to predict the next i.e the 4th word.
